# Servo Tester

Simple script that allows you to test a servo using a potentiometer to controll the servo. PWM is output to the serial terminal. Middle pin (wiper) of the pot goes to A2 of the arduino. Servo attaches to pin 9. Voltage goes to other pins of the pot. Make sure not to run the 5v power supply to Vin as it will burn the arduino.
